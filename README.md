# leaflet-eruv-map

This is a <a target="blank" href="https://leafletjs.com/">leaflet</a> map of my community's eruv. The boundary lines are generated by a kml file and the point locations are directly encoded within the html file. Plugins used include the following:
<ul>
  <li><a target="blank" href="https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-omnivore">Omnivore</a> - to add kml content to the map</li>
  <li><a target="blank" href="https://github.com/stefanocudini/leaflet-search">Leaflet-Search</a> - for geocoding</li>
  </ul>

The map can currently be viewed <a target="blank" href="https://mikeolkin.github.io/leaflet-eruv-map/Eruv.htm">here</a>.
